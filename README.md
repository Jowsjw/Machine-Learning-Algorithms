# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Everyone can use machine learning libraries to do machine learning work.

Nevertheless, it's my belief that the math behind those machine learning algorithms is much more important.

In this project, I will try to write code to realize machine learning algorithms based on my understanding of the math behinde the algorithms, don't use python machine learning libraries.
